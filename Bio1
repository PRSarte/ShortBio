  Hello! I am Patrick Ryan R. Sarte, a 19 year old second year college student from the University of Santo Tomas currently studying 
Electronics engineering. I am 5'4 weighing at around 50 to 60 kilograms. I am an avid fan and follower of e-sports of different titles
such as League of Legends and Counter-Strike:Global Offensive. I usually play video games when there is nothing left to do and I also 
play a few sports such as badminton and volleyball. My motto in life is to always finish what you started no matter what and this includes
this course that is quite challenging but I know I will become an electronics engineer as my passion for this course is never fading and
my love for electronics has never changed.
